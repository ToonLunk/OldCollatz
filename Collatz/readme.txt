This program was written by Toon Lunk (Tyler Chase Brock). Inspired by a YouTube video, I wanted to make a graphical
representation of the Collatz Conjecture - which can be read about here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture

I'm not a Mathematition, but I found the concept interesting and thought it would be neat to show what exactly is happening,
and effectively "auto-animate" the process, versus having to animate each number, as the person in the video did.

So far the user input and actual math is there, but I'm now working on the graphics portion. Aside from Web Development, and
game development with Unity, this is my first entry in custom GUIs.

REQUIREMENTS:

Windows: 
Python3 (installed by default in some versions, otherwise, run 'python3' in command line, then download from Windows Store')
